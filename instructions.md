# Summary
This repository serves as an example of pixel art. You'll use it as a template to create your own file.

## Extended Exercise
- Step one: Open up the `index.html` file in your browser.
- Step two: Applaud the artistic genius displayed in front of you.
- Step three: Standing ovations, please.
- Step four: Think about what you'd like your own file/pixel art to look like!
- Step five: In the `index.html` file, change line 6 from `octocat.js` to `YOUR_FILE_SUBJECT.js` (obviously, don't type YOUR_FILE_SUBJECT, but instead the name of whatever you intend to make. ex: emoji.js, sun.js).
- Step six: In your command line, type `git mv blanktemplate.js YOUR_FILE_SUBJECT.js`
- Step seven: Add and commit those changes.
- Step eight: Create a PR for your changes into the original upstream (the repository that you cloned from).
  - The steps for creating a PR to a fork are not on video, but you can click on the Pull Requests tab in the GitHub UI, followed by `Create new pull request`. Then, you should be at the expected place.
